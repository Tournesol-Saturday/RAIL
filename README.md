## üåü Abstract

Semi-supervised learning has become a compelling approach for 3D tooth segmentation from CBCT scans, where labeled data is minimal. However, existing methods still face two persistent challenges: limited corrective supervision in structurally ambiguous or mislabeled regions during supervised training and performance degradation caused by unreliable pseudo-labels on unlabeled data. To address these problems, we propose Region-Aware Instructive Learning (RAIL), a dual-group dual-student, semi-supervised framework. Each group contains two student models guided by a shared teacher network. By alternating training between the two groups, RAIL promotes intergroup knowledge transfer and collaborative region-aware instruction while reducing overfitting to the characteristics of any single model. Specifically, RAIL introduces two instructive mechanisms. Disagreement-Focused Supervision (DFS) Controller improves supervised learning by instructing predictions only within areas where student outputs diverge from both ground truth and the best student, thereby concentrating supervision on structurally ambiguous or mislabeled areas. In the unsupervised phase, Confidence-Aware Learning (CAL) Modulator reinforces agreement in regions with high model certainty while reducing the effect of low-confidence predictions during training. This helps prevent our model from learning unstable patterns and improves the overall reliability of pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on four CBCT tooth segmentation datasets show that RAIL surpasses state-ofthe-art methods under limited annotation.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Overview

![framework](assets/framework.png)

RAIL (Region-Aware Instructive Learning) is a novel dual-group, dual-student semi-supervised framework for medical image segmentation, specifically designed to address the issue of limited labeled data in CBCT-based 3D tooth segmentation. This approach introduces two key mechanisms:
- üîß **Disagreement-Focused Supervision (DFS) Controller:** Focuses on areas where model predictions diverge to improve supervision in anatomically ambiguous or mislabeled regions.
- üéØ **Confidence-Aware Learning (CAL) Modulator:** Enhances model stability by reinforcing high-confidence predictions and suppressing low-confidence pseudo-labels.

RAIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods under limited annotation scenarios, improving both segmentation accuracy and model reliability in medical imaging tasks.

## Requirements



## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment

Please follow these steps to create an environment and install the environment dependencies by `requirements.txt`:

```bash
conda create -n RAIL python=3.8
conda activate RAIL
git clone https://github.com/Tournesol-Saturday/RAIL.git;
cd ./RAIL;
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

[Optional] Download the model checkpoint and save it at `./model/RAIL_xx_xx_xx/outputs/xx/pmt_0_iter_xxxx_best.pth`
`./model/RAIL_xx_xx_xx/outputs/xx/pmt_1_iter_xxxx_best.pth`
`./model/RAIL_xx_xx_xx/outputs/xx/pmt_2_iter_xxxx_best.pth`
`./model/RAIL_xx_xx_xx/outputs/xx/pmt_3_iter_xxxx_best.pth`.

## üì¶ Dataset Preparation

We obtained two public datasets and preprocessed them in some way. All datasets are placed in the `./dataset` directory after preprocessing (data augmentation).

### üìä Dataset Preprocessing (Data Augmentation)

To expand the training dataset, we augmented the available CBCT scans by 1) intensity normalization, and 2) random cropped patches.

In this study, our CBCT data are stored in `.h5` format, which records the corresponding annotation information for a given scanned image (if it is an unlabeled image, the corresponding annotation information is all zeros). For both the training and validation sets (excluding the testing set), the data is scaled up to 15 times for each scan.

In `dataloaders/data_augmentation.py`, you need to define the paths to the image and annotation folders of the CBCT scans, and then you can use the following commands to implement the augmentation of labeled data:

```
dataloaders/data_augmentation.py
```

Then you can use the following command to implement the augmentation of unlabeled data:

```
dataloaders/data_augmentation_unlabeled.py
```

RAIL is a semi-supervised learning framework designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of 3D tooth segmentation from Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scans, particularly when labeled data is scarce. The framework leverages region-aware instruction mechanisms to focus on anatomically complex or ambiguous areas, significantly enhancing segmentation performance in the presence of unreliable pseudo-labels.

## üì∞ News!

- **[04/18/2025]** We provide RAIL model checkpoints trained on 3D_CBCT_Tooth_7_113, 3D_CBCT_Tooth_13_107, CTooth_7_115 and CTooth_13_109. Link: Extraction Code:
- **[04/15/2025]** RAIL framework code and models are now available! Please check out the [GitHub repository](#) for more details.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Overview

RAIL (Region-Aware Instructive Learning) is a novel dual-group, dual-student semi-supervised framework for medical image segmentation, specifically designed to address the issue of limited labeled data in CBCT-based 3D tooth segmentation. This approach introduces two key mechanisms:
- üîß **Disagreement-Focused Supervision (DFS) Controller:** Focuses on areas where model predictions diverge to improve supervision in anatomically ambiguous or mislabeled regions.
- üéØ *Confidence-Aware Learning (CAL) Modulator:** Enhances model stability by reinforcing high-confidence predictions and suppressing low-confidence pseudo-labels.

RAIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods under limited annotation scenarios, improving both segmentation accuracy and model reliability in medical imaging tasks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To perform inference locally with the debugger GUI, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tournesol-Saturday/RAIL.git;
cd ./RAIL;
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

[Optional] Download the model checkpoint and save it at `./model/RAIL_xx_xx_xx/outputs/xx/pmt_0_iter_xxxx_best.pth`.

## üì¶ Dataset Preparation

We obtained two public datasets and preprocessed them in some way. All datasets are placed in the `./dataset` directory after preprocessing (data augmentation).

### üìä Dataset Preprocessing (Data Augmentation)

To expand the training dataset, we augmented the available CBCT scans by 1) intensity normalization, and 2) random cropped patches.

In this study, our CBCT data are stored in `.h5` format, which records the corresponding annotation information for a given scanned image (if it is an unlabeled image, the corresponding annotation information is all zeros). For both the training and validation sets (excluding the testing set), the data is scaled up to 15 times for each scan.

In `dataloaders/data_augmentation.py`, you need to define the paths to the image and annotation folders of the CBCT scans, and then you can use the following commands to implement the augmentation of labeled data:

```
dataloaders/data_augmentation.py
```

Then you can use the following command to implement the augmentation of unlabeled data:

```
dataloaders/data_augmentation_unlabeled.py
```
